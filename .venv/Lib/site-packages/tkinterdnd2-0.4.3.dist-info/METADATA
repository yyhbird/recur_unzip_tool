lb.insert(1, "drag files to here")

# register the listbox as a drop target
lb.drop_target_register(DND_FILES)
lb.dnd_bind('<<Drop>>', lambda e: lb.insert(tk.END, e.data))

## What is TkinterDnD2

[TkinterDnD2](http://tkinterdnd.sourceforge.net) is a python wrapper for George Petasis' tkDnD Tk extension version 2.

It is a domain public project.

## What is TkDnD2

[tkDnD2](https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd) is a tcl/Tk extension adding native drag and drop support.

## What this repository is about

This repo package TkinterDnD2 and tkdnd2 into a standard python module.

When the extension is imported in python its location will be automatically added to the Tk search path.

This repository contains the compiled binaries from https://github.com/petasis/tkdnd/releases/tag/tkdnd-release-test-v2.9.4. In order to provide support on ARM, we include built binaries from the now defunct [tkinterdnd2-universal](https://pypi.org/project/tkinterdnd2-universal/#files) which added ARM support.

## pyinstaller

When using `pyinstaller`, you should use the hook-tkinterdnd2.py file included to collect the TkDnD binaries and build them into the project. To use it, copy it into the base directory of your project, then run pyinstaller as follows:

    pyinstaller -F -w myproject/myproject.py --additional-hooks-dir=.
